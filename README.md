used in the city life.The colour scheme will contain a collection of 16

The ‘warmCrush’ palette will contain rustic and warm colours e.g shades
of red, orange etc. These colours would be strong colours that are
intense and bring about a warming effect.The ‘coldCrush’ palette will
contain colours that are calm and smooth e.g. shades of blue, light
purple etc.
